# PyBer Ride Analysis
Analyzing/ visualizing PyBer ridesharing data with Matplotlib and Pandas.

# Resources
Python 3.9.12 and Jupyter Notebook 3.3.2
city_data.csv and ride_data.csv

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to understand ridership and fare relationship by the types of cities operated by Pyber. 
Creating visualizations of how data differs by city type and how these differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

# Results
After going through and analysing PyBer city/ ride data i have come to following conclusions-

1. Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
2. Urban cities have roughly 5 times more drivers than suburban cities.
3. Urban city type has highest total revenue (total fare).
4. Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and per driver.
5. The summary data plot shows fare revenue is higher by city type where there is a larger number of drivers to rides.

# Summary
Based on the analysis on Pyber rideshare data -
Increasing the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and Urban cities. Reducing the fare and increasing the drivers will have similar impact on revenue generation for Pyber like in Urban cities.
